			<h2>preparatory school</h2>
			<p>In my preparatory school, I gained experience in basic 
				computer skills such as typing, using Microsoft Office 
				applications, and navigating the internet. I also learned
				 how to troubleshoot basic computer problems and how to use various software
				  programs. Overall, my experience in computer skills during my preparatory 
				  school has provided me with
				 a strong foundation for further learning and development
				  in the field of technology. English Language: In preschool,
				   I learned English, including tenses, phrases, and sentence structures. 
				  I also expanded my vocabulary by studying numerous words.

				  Strong Academic Performance: During my studies, I excelled
				   in subjects such as math, physics, biology, and civics. I consistently achieved
				    high scores and maintained an average result of 95%.

			<h2> fresh IT student</h2>
			<p>As a Fresh IT Student, I further improved my computer skills and gained
				 experience in various areas. I learned how to install applications and
				  software on different operating systems such as Ubuntu, Windows,
				   Linux, and Kali. I also developed an understanding of how operating 
				   systems work and how to navigate and troubleshoot them. Additionally, 
				   I learned about subnetting and IP addressing, which are essential networking
				    concepts. Moreover, I gained knowledge of how command lines work and how to use
					 them effectively. Overall, my experience as a Fresh IT Student allowed me to
					  enhance
				 my technical skills and broaden my understanding of computer 
				 systems and networking.</p>

			<h2>fresh software student</h2>
			<p>on this year  I focused on further developing my programming skills and
				 expanding my knowledge in networking. I learned programming languages
				  such as C and C++ using compilers like Code::Blocks and Dev++.
				   I gained proficiency in writing code, understanding syntax, and solving problems
				    using these languages. Additionally, I delved into networking concepts such as
					 how switches, routers, and default gateways work. I also had the opportunity
					  to apply my programming skills by creating projects, including an ATM banking
					   service using C and a library management system using C++. These projects
					    allowed me to apply my programming knowledge
				 to real-world scenarios and further enhance my problem-solving abilities.</p>

			<h2>back-end software developer</h2>
			<p>As a 3rd year student, I focused on developing my skills
				 as a back-end developer. I learned JavaScript and PHP programming
				  languages, which are commonly used for server-side development.
				   I also gained knowledge about databases such as MySQL, MongoDB, and PostgreSQL,
				    and learned how
				 to work with SQL for relational databases. Additionally,
				  I learned about JSON files and how they are used to store 
				  and exchange data. I gained an understanding of APIs (Application 
				  Programming Interfaces) and how they facilitate communication between
				   different software systems.

				Furthermore, I learned about Axios, a popular JavaScript
				 library used for making HTTP requests. I also delved into topics like
				  authentication and authorization, understanding how these processes
				   work in web applications. I learned about middleware, which is a crucial
				    component in web development frameworks, and how it helps with request
					 handling and processing.
				
				Currently, I am expanding my knowledge by studying CSS, HTML, 
				and the React library. I am also exploring frameworks like Bootstrap
				 and Tailwind CSS to become a full-stack web developer. These skills will
				  allow me to work on both the front-end and back-end of web applications, 
				  making me proficient in developing complete and dynamic websites.</p>
